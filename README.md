Problem Statement.
Develop an algorithm for an outreach program that aims to identify and provide support to underprivileged students in need of educational resources.

Sub-Problems.
1. Student Assessment: Evaluate the academic performance and resource requirements of individual students.
2. Resource Allocation: Determine the appropriate allocation of educational resources to meet the specific needs of each student.
3. Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuously monitor the progress of students and assess the effectiveness of the outreach program.

Sub-Solutions.
Sub-Solution 1. Student Assessment
1. Assess Student Performance
   - Evaluate the academic performance of a student based on their subjects.
   - Calculate the overall performance of the student.
2. Determine Resource Requirements.
   - Determine the specific resource requirements (e.g., tutoring or study materials) based on the student's academic performance.

Sub-Solution 2. Resource Allocation
1. Allocate Resources.
   - Determine and allocate the appropriate educational resources to each student based on their resource needs and the availability of resources.
2. Update Resource Availability.
   - Update the availability of educational resources after allocating them to students.

Sub-Solution 3. Monitoring and Evaluation
1. Track Student Progress.
   - Continuously monitor the academic progress of each student.
   - Determine if the students are improving or not based on their performance.
2. Assess Program Effectiveness:
   - Assess the overall effectiveness of the outreach program based on the progress of the students.
   - Calculate the percentage of students who are showing improvement.

Necessary Functions.
Sub-Solution 1. Student Assessment
- AssessStudentPerformance (student Name, subjects): Assess the academic performance of a student based on their subjects and calculate their overall performance.
- DetermineResourceRequirements (academic Performance): Determine the resource requirements (e.g., tutoring or study materials) based on the student's academic performance.

Sub-Solution 2. Resource Allocation
- allocate Resources (students, available Resources, student Needs): Allocate the appropriate educational resources to each student based on their resource needs and the availability of resources.
- UpdateResourceAvailability (available Resources, allocated Resources): Update the availability of educational resources after allocating them to students.

Sub-Solution 3. Monitoring and Evaluation
- TrackStudentProgress (students, student Performance, baseline Performance): Track the academic progress of each student and determine if they are improving or not.
- AssessProgramEffectiveness (student Progress): Assess the overall effectiveness of the outreach program based on the progress of the students.

 Defining of Variables.
